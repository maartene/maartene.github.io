<p>Maarten Engels built the Twinkle Star Tracer app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Maarten Engels at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

<p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.</p>

<p>This Service tries to collect as little personally identifiable information (exceptions may apply if you are part of the Beta Test, see the section on &quot;Beta Test&quot; below). </p>

<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>

<p>The Service is designed not to collect and use any personally identifiable information. The only data the Service saves by design is save game data. However, it does use the Unity third party SDK, that requires data collection to function correctly. As far as I'm aware this only applies to &quot;technical information&quot; (i.e. device ID, device type, OS version, screen size, etc.) because Unity Ads and Unity Analytics are not used in this Service. Please see the <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">Unity privacy policy</a> for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnostics Data</strong></p>

<p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, of an error in the app I collect data and information on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

<p>This data is not accessable to me, unless you specifically opted in to Apple's &quot;App Analysis&quot; and choose to share this information with app developers (such as me). See &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Privacy&quot; -&gt; &quot;Analysis and Improvements&quot; on your iOS device for details.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>

<p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app does use third party code and libraries. I've taken care to ensure these do not use cookies themselves, however it is possible that in a future update of the third party code and libraries, they start setting cookies. I will do my best to prevent this from happening, but can't guarantee it so will assume no liability if it does. If you find this Service (trying to) set cookies, please notify me at privacy@thedreamweb.eu.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>

<p>This Service does not use any Service Providers.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>

<p>This Service does not contain any links to other Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>

<p>This Service is aimed at small children. As a parent myself providing a safe digital experience to children is a great priority to me. This is one of the reasons this Service (to the best of my knowledge) does not collect any personally identifiable information nor does it provide a way of sharing is. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take necessary actions.</p>

<p><strong>Beta Test</strong></p>

<p>If you are a part of the Service's Beta Test (i.e. you received and accepted an invitation from TestFlight) you agree to share technical information with me that helps me improve the Service. These can include and are not limited to Log Data, screenshots, and any feedback you might give on the Service. This data will be linked to personally identifiable information such as your name and e-mail address. I will only use the data collected through TestFlight to improve the Service. Your data will not be shared with or sold to any third party providers, unless strictly necesarry to provide the TestFlight service (i.e. Apple). By using the Service through TestFlight, you agree to this collection and processing of data.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

<p>This policy is effective as of 2021-04-15</p>

<p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at privacy@thedreamweb.eu.</p>
